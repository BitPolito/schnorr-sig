# Schnorr Signatures

This is a **Schnorr signatures utility** for *educational purposes* only, developed by BIT PoliTO in Python3.

The classic signature and verification functions are developed from the BIP340 reference implementation, while we tried to keep as close as possible to it the MuSig functions, even if they are not specified (yet).

## Scripts

There are four main scripts:

- #### Key pair creator
`create_keypair.py` creates one or more key pairs which are stored in a JSON file and can be used to sign and verify a message.
**Syntax**: `create_keypair.py -n <number of keys>`

- #### Schnorr signer
`schnorr_sign.py` returns the signature from one or more private keys and a message. <br>
**Syntax**: `schnorr_sign.py [--musig1 || --musig2] (optional) -m <message>`

- #### Schnorr verifier
`schnorr_verify.py` returns `True` or `False` from a signature, a single public key or an aggregated one, and a message. <br>
**Syntax**: `schnorr_verify.py -s <signature> -p <public_key> -m <message>`

- #### Schnorr tester
`schnorr_test.py` is the BIP340 reference implementation minimally changed to perform a test from the `test-vector.csv`. <br>
See <https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0340.mediawiki> and the reference implementation at <https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/tree/master/bip-0340>.

All the functions used in those scripts are collected in the library `schnorr_lib.py`.

## How to install and run code
We used Python3 to write these scripts.

### Installation
```console
# clone the repo
$ git clone https://github.com/BITPoliTO/schnorr-sig.git

# change the working directory to schnorr-sig
$ cd schnorr-sig

# install general requirements
$ pip install typing 
```

### Usage
```console
$ python create_keypair.py -n <number_of_keys>
$ python schnorr_sign.py [--musig1 || --musig2] (optional) -m <message>
$ python schnorr_verify.py -s <signature> -p <public_key> -m <message>
```

## Jupyter
The code can also be launched from a Jupyter Notebook, thanks to the script collected in the library "schnorr.ipynb".
```console
# Download Jupyter Notebook
$ pip install notebook

# Launch
$ python -m notebook
```

Select the schnorr.ipynb file from your folders and enjoy! You can:
- generate your own keypairs;
- generate a Schnorr, MuSig1 or MuSig2 signature;
- check that the obtained signature is valid.
